# Example of Dynamic Inputs for ComfyUI

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f5ac899-66ed-459b-8a61-5825f87853db)

An example for how to do the specific mechanism of adding dynamic inputs to a node.

## Why is this a thing?

Because a lot of people ask the same questions over and over and the examples are always in some type of compound setup which requires unwinding a lot of extra code or logic that is not required to answer the main question.

## How is this different than having to pull apart all those other repositories?

The example is kept to (at most) two files:
* The python entry point
* The supporting js
This keeps the focus on the actual problem being solved.

The file names for the nodes will match in name to the node example they represent.

## Installation:

Clone this repository to 'ComfyUI/custom_nodes` folder.

There are no extra requirements.

# Node List

## Dynamic Node (cozy)
